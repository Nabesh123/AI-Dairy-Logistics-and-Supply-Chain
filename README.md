# AI-Dairy-Logistics-and-Supply-Chain
This project presents an AI-driven solution to enhance the Indian dairy supply chain through Milk Supply Prediction and Route Optimization. Traditional fixed routes and manual planning cause delays, fuel waste, and supply fluctuations. The system forecasts next-day milk volume using historical and real-time data, and generates dynamic, efficient pickup routes based on traffic, GPS, and predicted supply. A unified dashboard enables real-time tracking, alerts, and automated farmer communication. The solution reduces costs, minimizes spoilage, and improves operational planning. Inspired by Kriti Labs’ practical AI + IoT approach, this project addresses real-world dairy challenges.
